# Data-Selfie-App

> Here is a small web application that geolocates where you take selfie and create a collection of it along with some meta data. This app was a nice starting point for self-tracking applications.


## Setup

In your terminal to install the requirements:
```sh
npm install
```

then start your server:
```sh
npm start
```
or if in development: 
```sh
npm run dev
```
as soon as you start the server you will find `database.db` file in your directory.

Now go to: `localhost:3030` and explore! 

## Features (coming soon)

- [ ] Authentication and login
- [ ] querying other APIs (e.g. Weather/Air Quality)
